To run a Node.js script on your computer using PM2, follow these steps:
1. Install PM2:
If you don't have PM2 installed, install it globally using npm:
Kode

npm install -g pm2
2. Start your Node.js application:
Navigate to the directory containing your Node.js script (e.g., app.js) and use PM2 to start it:
Kode

pm2 start app.js
Explanation of the command:
pm2 start: This command initiates the process of starting your application with PM2.
app.js: This is the name of your main Node.js script file. Replace app.js with the actual name of your script.
Optional: Naming your process
You can give your application a specific name for easier management:
Kode

3. Verify your application is running:
To see a list of all processes managed by PM2 and check the status of your application:

Kode

pm2 save
5. View logs (optional):
To view the logs of your application in real-time:

Replace my-node-app with the actual name of your application if you named it.
