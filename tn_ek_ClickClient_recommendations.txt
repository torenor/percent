Recommendations to optimize `tn_ek_ClickClient.js` for production

Summary
- Remove or gate verbose console output in production builds.
- Replace ad-hoc console calls with a small logger wrapper controlled by a runtime or build-time flag.
- Prefer non-blocking telemetry (navigator.sendBeacon) for unload events.
- Reduce and scope MutationObserver and polling usage to limit CPU and memory overhead.
- Strip console.* calls in production builds using your bundler/minifier.

Quick wins (apply immediately)
1) Add a lightweight logger wrapper near the top of the file so a single flag controls debug output. In production the logger can be silenced while still allowing errors to be recorded or forwarded to remote monitoring.
2) Replace the single unguarded console.log("Page view data sent successfully.", data) with the logger so it is suppressed in production.
3) Keep the DEBUG_TRACKING flag configurable via a small runtime variable (e.g., window.__TRACKING_DEBUG__).

Build-time removals
- If you use Babel: install and configure `babel-plugin-transform-remove-console` (or `transform-remove-console`) to strip console calls during production builds. Configure it to remove only non-error console calls if you want to keep console.error.
- If you use webpack + Terser: set terserOptions.compress.drop_console = true in production to drop console.* calls entirely. Also set DefinePlugin to 'production' to allow dead-code elimination.

Runtime/logging changes
- Logger wrapper pattern (suggestion):
  - Provide a single boolean to enable debug (from window.__TRACKING_DEBUG__ or derived from NODE_ENV-like flag).
  - Expose logger.debug/info/log/warn/error. Debug/info/log call through the wrapper only when enabled; keep error always visible or send to remote.
- Example runtime flag resolution: prefer a window flag for non-bundled scripts or use build-time DEFINE replacement for bundled assets.
- Consider sending errors to a remote collector (Sentry, LogRocket) instead of printing raw stacks to console in production.

Reducing runtime overhead
- Narrow MutationObserver scope: observe only the element(s) that host dynamic content or modals instead of document.body subtree. Observing entire body is expensive on dynamic apps.
- Debounce the MutationObserver callback; ignore unrelated mutations early (e.g., check if mutation.target matches selectors of interest).
- Reduce polling: set a longer interval (e.g., 2000ms) or enable polling only as a short-lived fallback (stop after N seconds if nothing detected). Polling indefinitely at 800ms can be costly on busy pages.
- Make snapshot comparisons lightweight: limit snapshot length (slice first N chars) or compute a small hash instead of comparing entire textContent.
- Avoid redundant DOM queries: in scheduleSend(), collectPageData() is called multiple times; capture values once per invocation when possible.

Event listeners and memory
- Use `{ once: true }` where appropriate for single-use listeners.
- Remove observers/listeners on teardown if your script can be re-initialized or unloaded in single-page apps.
- Use passive listeners for scroll/touch events to avoid blocking the main thread.

Telemetry and network
- Use `navigator.sendBeacon` for fire-and-forget telemetry tied to unload or visibility changes; fallback to fetch when necessary.
- Put the analytics `endpoint` in a runtime configuration (not hard-coded) so it can be rotated or changed without code edits.
- Consider batching frequent events and sending in a single request to reduce network overhead.

Security and privacy
- Avoid sending PII. Trim or anonymize any user content before sending.
- Serve the script via HTTPS and authenticate or sign telemetry to prevent abuse if needed.
- Do not serve source-maps publicly in production; upload them privately to your error tracking service.

Packaging and deployment
- Build and minify for production. Serve from a CDN and use cache headers.
- Use Subresource Integrity (SRI) if loading third-party scripts from CDNs.

Testing and monitoring
- Profile with Lighthouse and browser devtools to confirm observers and polling are not causing high CPU.
- Add a couple of unit tests for pure functions (collectPageData, shouldSend) and one integration test that mocks fetch/sendBeacon.
- Use a bundle analyzer to find large dependencies and track bundle size regressions.

Suggested minimal code changes (low-risk)
1) Insert a logger wrapper and swap the unguarded console.log:
   - Keep console.error calls, but route non-critical logs through logger so they can be disabled.
2) Limit polling lifetime. Example behavior: enable polling for the first 30 seconds after page load, then turn it off unless some flag re-enables it.

How to apply
- If you maintain a bundler: add the babel plugin or configure Terser in production and set process.env.NODE_ENV via DefinePlugin.
- If you don't use a bundler: add the logger wrapper and use `window.__TRACKING_DEBUG__ = true` during testing; set it false in production.

Next steps I can take for you (pick one):
- Apply a small safe patch that inserts the logger wrapper and replaces the single unguarded console.log with logger.info in `tn_ek_ClickClient.js`.
- Produce sample `webpack.config.js` and `babel.config.json` snippets to strip console.* calls in production builds.
- Implement a polling fallback that auto-disables after N seconds and reduce MutationObserver scope.
