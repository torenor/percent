Mermaid itself does not have built-in pan and zoom functionality for its rendered diagrams within an HTML page. However, you can achieve this by integrating a separate JavaScript library designed for SVG manipulation, as Mermaid renders diagrams as SVG.
One common approach involves using a library like svg-pan-zoom.
Steps to integrate pan and zoom with svg-pan-zoom:
Include the svg-pan-zoom library: Add the svg-pan-zoom library to your HTML page, typically before your Mermaid script. You can include it via a CDN or by hosting the file locally.
Kode

    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/svg-pan-zoom@latest/dist/svg-pan-zoom.min.js"></script>
Initialize svg-pan-zoom after Mermaid rendering: After Mermaid has rendered your diagram into an SVG element, you need to initialize svg-pan-zoom on that SVG element. Ensure the SVG element has an id for easy selection.
Kode

    <div id="mermaid-diagram">
        graph TD
            A[Start] --> B(Process);
            B --> C{Decision};
            C -- Yes --> D[End];
            C -- No --> B;
    </div>

    <script>
        mermaid.initialize({ startOnLoad: true });

        // Wait for Mermaid to render the diagram (you might need a small delay or a custom event)
        // For simplicity, we'll use a timeout here. In a real application, consider a more robust solution.
        setTimeout(() => {
            const svgElement = document.querySelector('#mermaid-diagram svg');
            if (svgElement) {
                svgPanZoom(svgElement, {
                    zoomEnabled: true,
                    controlIconsEnabled: true, // Optional: Add default zoom/pan controls
                    fit: true,
                    center: true,
                    minZoom: 0.1,
                    maxZoom: 10
                });
            }
        }, 100); // Adjust delay as needed
    </script>
Explanation:
mermaid.initialize({ startOnLoad: true }); tells Mermaid to process any Mermaid syntax found in the HTML on page load.
The setTimeout is a basic way to ensure the SVG element exists after Mermaid has rendered. For more complex scenarios, you might need to use a MutationObserver or a callback if Mermaid provides one.
document.querySelector('#mermaid-diagram svg'); selects the SVG element generated by Mermaid within your container.
svgPanZoom(svgElement, { ... }); initializes the svg-pan-zoom library on the selected SVG element with various configuration options for zoom, pan controls, initial fitting, and zoom limits.
This approach allows you to add interactive pan and zoom capabilities to your Mermaid diagrams within a web page.
